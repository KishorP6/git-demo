##Kaggle news feed
If you also use iterative prediction, here is my opinion of selecting features. Since iterative prediction does not directly get the whole 28 days of validation, so I select features in a unsmooth sequence. Which is similar to the idea of TS split.

##DS oppurtunity
This is a unique opportunity to collaborate with our world-class team of chemists, biologists, and computer scientists to expand the groupâ€™s efforts applying machine learning to drug discovery, biomolecular simulation, and biophysics. Ideal candidates will have demonstrated expertise in developing deep learning techniques, as well as strong Python programming skills. Relevant areas of experience might include molecular dynamics, structural biology, medicinal chemistry, cheminformatics, and/or quantum chemistry, but specific knowledge of any of these areas is less critical than outstanding intellectual ability and a track record of achievement and innovation in the field of machine learning.
